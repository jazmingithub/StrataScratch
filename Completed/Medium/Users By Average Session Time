Calculate each user's average session time. 
A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. 
For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, 
consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit. Output the user_id and their average session time.


-- This query required a self join to parse out the loading page time stamp and the exit page time stamp 
-- the :: synatx is PostgreSQL shorthand for cast. See example below 
-- CAST ( expression AS type )
-- expression::type
-- reference https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/sql-expressions.html#SQL-SYNTAX-TYPE-CASTS

Select 
    session_duration.user_id, 
    avg(session_duration.user_duration) as avg
From 
    (select 
        load.user_id, 
        load.timestamp::date as date,
    -- Session duration is found by getting the difference between latest page_load and earliest page_exit
        (min(exit.timestamp:: timestamp) - max(load.timestamp:: timestamp)) as user_duration
    from facebook_web_log as load
    Join facebook_web_log as exit 
        on load.user_id = exit.user_id
    where load.action = 'page_load' 
        and exit.action = 'page_exit'
        and exit.timestamp > load.timestamp
    Group by load.user_id, load.timestamp::date) as session_duration
Group by session_duration.user_id
