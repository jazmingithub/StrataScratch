-- This one was a head-scratcher scince the approached tip 
-- said to use the RANK() function but I was getting the 
-- incorrect order of profits with the query below 
-- the inner query displayed the correct rank but once 
-- i included the where clause it showed the incorrect rank 

select 
    company,
    profits
from 
    (select 
        company,
        profits,
        Rank() Over
            (Order By profits DESC) as Rank
    from forbes_global_2010_2014
    where rank > 4) as a 
order by profits DESC 



-- this querry works because there are no duplicates 

select 
    company, 
    profits 
from forbes_global_2010_2014  
order by profits desc 
limit 3
