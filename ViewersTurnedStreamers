From users who had their first session as a viewer, how many streamer sessions have they had? 
Return the user id and number of sessions in descending order. 
In case there are users with the same number of sessions, order them by ascending user id.

select * from twitch_sessions;

select *
from twitch_sessions
where user_id = '0'
order by session_start;



-- identify whcih users had their first session as a viewer 
  -- order sessions based on date 
 SELECT user_id, 
        session_type, 
        rank() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY session_start) streams_order
FROM twitch_sessions
 
  -- use a subquier to select users that were viewers in stream_order
SELECT user_id
FROM (
     SELECT user_id, 
        session_type, 
        rank() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY session_start) streams_order
     FROM twitch_sessions)
WHERE streams_order = 1 
    AND session type = 'viewer'

-- there 4 differnt RANK functinos are ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE()
-- the OVER() claused is used to define a set of rows in the results 
-- the PARTITION BY clause defines the subset of data in a partition
